    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal">
        Several
        factors may be considered in choosing or planning a career. Job satisfaction
        depends on how well the various characteristics of a job satisfy employees’
        interests and values. In exploring an occupation, the following ten (10) job
        characteristic factors are considered by most people. <br>
        <br>

            <span style="color:blue">
                1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
                Nature of the Work:
            </span>
        </b> <br>
        Some jobs chiefly involve working with things, and others mainly require
        dealing with people or information. Most jobs combine a variety of work
        activities. You should therefore look for an occupation that involves
        activities you enjoy and can do well. <br>
        <br>
        <b>
            <span style="color:blue">
                2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working
                Conditions:
            </span>
        </b> <br>
        This refers to the environment in which a particular job is done. A work
        environment might be indoors or outdoors. Some jobs involve high level of dust,
        noise, physical hazards, or mental stress. Other conditions to consider include
        the number of hours employees work each week and whether employees work as
        individuals or as groups. <br>
        <br>
        <b>
            <span style="color:blue">
                3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special
                Abilities Required:
            </span>
        </b> <br>
        Some jobs call for more mechanical aptitude, artistic talent or other abilities
        than most people possess. You should therefore be aware of any special
        requirements of the jobs you are considering. <br>
        <br>
        <b>
            <span style="color:blue">
                4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical
                Demands:
            </span>
        </b> <br>
        Some occupations make special physical demands on workers. For example, jobs
        that involve carrying and lifting heavy objects may require strength. Some
        occupations require workers to perform repetitive tasks. Other occupations may
        require workers to stand for long hours example, working in a production line.
        Other occupations may yet require workers to have keen vision. When you
        consider a job, be sure you can meet the physical demands the work might make
        on you before settling for it. <br>

                5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation
                Needed:
            </span>
        </b> <br>
        The amount of preparation required to enter an occupation varies from
        occupation to occupation. It can range from a few hours of training to more
        than ten years of education beyond high school level. In addition, workers in
        many occupations or professions must continue their education to keep their
        jobs or to advance in them. Some occupations require several years of
        experience and preparation at the lower-level jobs. You should thus consider
        how much time and finances you might have to invest in that career that
        interests you. <br>

                6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chances
                of Employment:
            </span>
        </b> <br>
        Before you choose a career field, you should consider your chances of getting
        jobs in that field. In businesses and industries with steady or decreasing
        employment, workers are hired only to replace employees who have left their
        jobs or have gone on retirement. In growing businesses and industries however,
        additional workers are needed to fill the growing and expansionary needs of
        such companies. The introduction of new products and advanced technologies
        affect employment opportunities. Government spending and economic conditions
        also alter job opportunities. All these factors must therefore be considered
        carefully before choosing a career field. <br>
        <br>

                7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probable
                Earning:
            </span>
        </b> <br>
        In exploring careers, you will want to know how much money you can expert to
        earn. Government, professional and trade publications supply information on
        probable earnings for occupations. Pay scales may however, vary with location
        and employers. Trade union agreements and the amount of education and
        experience required also affect salaries and wages. Many employers provide
        insurance coverage, paid vacations, and other such fringe benefits, which you
        should consider in addition to probable earnings. <br>
        <br>

                for Advancement:
            </span>
        </b> <br>
        Another thing you should consider in a career choice decision is that you
        should examine possible patterns of promotion, known as career ladders or
        career paths. In some occupations, workers are promoted to higher positions
        based on their ability and experience. However, some employers employ people
        from outside the company to fill high-level openings. If employers consistently
        do this, workers can advance only by changing jobs. Some occupations also allow
        only limited advancement. Workers in such fields must obtain additional
        education or training or change occupation if they want to advance. <br>

                Status:
            </span>
        </b> <br>
        Social status refers to a person’s rank or position in society. Many people
        believe that certain jobs have higher social status than others do. Some people
        who value status seek it through choosing highly regarded occupations. You must
        decide for yourself how important social status is to you in making career
        choices. <br>

                Elements of the Job Market:
            </span>
        </b> <br>
        The job market is made up of the following; <br>
        The public sector <br>
        The private sector and <br>
        The popular/voluntary sector <br>
        <br>
        The private sector is that part of the economy which is both run for private
        profit and is not controlled by the state. By contrast, enterprises that are
        part of the state are part of the public sector; private, non-profit organizations
        are regarded as part of the popular or voluntary sector. Each of these sectors
        has their advantages and disadvantages. In choosing a career in any of these
        sectors requires a thorough study of how each of them operates and the benefits
        in working for each of them.
